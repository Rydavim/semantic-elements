  Semantic Elements Summary:
  Semantic elements clearly convey their meaning to the developers working with the code as well as the browsers which interpret and display the web page. These elements make your code more descriptive and can help provide necessary context for accessibility devices. HTML is all about structure, and semantic elements provide much more explicit structure than blocks and blocks of div tags.
